<h4>Motivation for writing this book</h4>

 In recent years, linear mixed models have come to be widely adopted in all areas of science.  However, the underlying theory needed to use such computational tools sensibly is often inaccessible because end-users don't necessarily have the statistical and mathematical background to read the primary textbooks. In this book, we seek to cover this gap, by providing a relatively accessible and technically non-demanding introduction to the basic workflow for fitting different kinds of linear mixed models using the lme4 package in R.<br>

 The book is aimed at researchers working in experimentally-focused areas (psychology, linguistics, psycholinguistics, and related disciplines). For this reason, we use real data-sets from psycholinguistics and related fields to demonstrate the  capabilities of linear mixed models.
